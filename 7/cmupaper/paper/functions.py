"""
General rules:
    (1) How will the WebApp call these APIs?
    Say we have an API foo(...) defined in this file. The upper layer Application
    will invoke these API through a wrapper in the following way:

    database_wrapper(...):
        conn = None
        try:
            conn = psycopg2.connection()
            res = foo(conn, ...)
            return res
        except psycopg2.DatabaseError, e:
            print "Error %s: " % e.argsp[0]
            conn.rollback()
            return DB_ERROR, None
        finally:
            if conn:
                conn.close()

    So, you don't need to care about the establishment and termination of
    the database connection, we will pass it as a parameter to the api.

    (2) General pattern for return value.
    Return value of every API defined here is a two element tuples (status, res).
    Status indicates whether the API call is success or not. Status = 0 means success,
    otherwise the web app will identify the error type by the value of the status.

    Res is the actual return value from the API. If the API has no return value, it should be
    set to None. Otherwise it could be any python data structures or primitives.
